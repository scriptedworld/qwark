# The two-word interface. Ten recipes, the same words in every tree here.
#
# This file defines no recipe except `default`, and it has to stay that way.
# just 1.58.0 lets an importing file beat what it imports, so any recipe
# written here would permanently shadow the language layer's real one. Among
# imports the first listed wins, which is why the order below runs from most
# specific to least.
#
# Without `allow-duplicate-recipes` there is no override at all. Under just
# 1.58.0, a base and a language layer that both define `test` produce a hard
# error that kills every recipe in the tree, not a shadowed definition:
#
#     $ just --list
#     error: recipe `test` first defined on line 3 is redefined on line 15
#
# `just test`, `just checks`, all of them fail with the same error. The setting
# turns that error into first-listed-wins. It is not a tidiness flag: removing
# it stops the tree outright.
#
#     just/project.just   this project's own. No template writes it.
#     just/lang.just      the language layer's.
#     just/base.just      the ten, supplied for every project.
#
# `default` is the exception and has to be here: defined in an import it is not
# found, and bare `just` answers "justfile contains no default recipe".
#
# Every project here exposes the same two-word interface.
